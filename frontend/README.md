<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process

<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->

- Implemented CRUD functionalities for managing plants.
- Used `MVC/MVVM` design architecture for organizing the code structure.
- Integrated `Axios` for making API requests.
- Styled the application using `React Bootstrap` and `Tailwind CSS`.
- Used `Express` for setting up the server and handling routes.
- Connected to `MongoDB` using `Mongoose`.

#### Highlights

<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->

- Successfully implemented the CRUD functionalities.
- Improved my understanding of React hooks and state management.

#### Challenges

<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->

- Encountered issues with state management and passing props between components.
- Debugging API request failures and ensuring proper CORS configuration.

### Reviews & Testing

<!-- stipulate how you've conducted testing in the form of peer reviews, feedback and also functionality testing, like unit tests (if applicable) -->

#### Feedback from Reviews

`Peer Reviews` were conducted by my fellow students and lecturer. The following feedback I found useful:

- Ensure all functionalities are user-friendly and intuitive.
- Improve the UI design for better user experience.

#### Unit Tests

`Unit Tests` were conducted to establish working functionality. Here are all the tests that were run:

- Test 1: Ensure that a plant can be successfully added.
- Test 2: Ensure that a plant's details can be updated.
- Test 3: Ensure that a plant can be deleted.

### Future Implementation

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- Implement search functionality to find plants easily.
- Add user authentication and authorization.
- Enhance the UI/UX with more detailed design elements.
